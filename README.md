# ASSIGNMENT-2
Task 1:
Step 1: Start

Step 2: Input a number
  Prompt the user: "Enter a number:"
  Store the input in a variable n

Step 3: Check if the number is even
  Compute the remainder when n is divided by 2 → n % 2

Step 4: If the remainder is 0, then
  Display: "[n] is an even number."

Step 5: Otherwise
  Display: "[n] is an odd number."

Step 6: Stop

Task2:
Step 1: Start

Step 2: Initialize variables
  Set sum = 0
  Set i = 1

Step 3: Repeat the following steps while i <= 50
  a) Add i to sum → sum = sum + i
  b) Increment i by 1 → i = i + 1

Step 4: When the loop ends, display the result
  Output: "The sum of numbers from 1 to 50 is: [sum]"

Step 5: Stop
